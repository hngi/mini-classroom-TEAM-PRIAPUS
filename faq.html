                        Get your certificate: When you successfully complete an Online Course, you are eligible to receive a digital certificate of completion. We encourage you to review your instructor’s syllabus to understand the Certificate of Completion requirements for your course. These requirements often include the following:
                        Active participation in the majority of discussion boards
                        Timely submission of all assignments.
                        Certificates of Completion are delivered to the email used at the time of registration, and can be expected no later than 3 weeks after the course ends. These digital verified credentials allow you to present a trustworthy record of your learning to anyone at any time.  
                        Our certificate platform, Accredible, permits you to share your achievement on various social media platforms, embed it on your website, and add it to your LinkedIn profile.</p>
